# Introducing myself 👩🏻‍💼
Hello, I'm Eleni! I have a master's degree in Physics. I found a new passion working with data. I have excellent computer skills, I'm familiar with SQL and Python, detail-oriented and organized, with the ability to clean and transform data to derive meaningful insights. I'm well qualified with tools such as Power BI and Tableau.
